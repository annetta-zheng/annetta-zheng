[Web3 Muyu (Wooden Fish) Meditation DApp](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/web3-cyber-muyu-qd7fo) allows users accumulate Gongde (virtue) by clicking on the Muyu icon. When a specific amount of gongde is acquired, users can mint NFTs representing their spiritual journey and cultural engagement.

Blockchain Integration: Developed with Hardhat for ETH smart contract development, React for the user interface, and NEON EVM for smart contract deployment, this DApp employs smart contracts to manage Gongde accumulation and NFT minting and viewing. Each click on the Muyu increases the user's Gongde, and when a specific Fongde threshold is reached, the user can mint a unique NFT that represents their spiritual journey and engagement with the app.

How it's Made
Smart Contract: Smart contracts are deployed on the NEON EVM TestNet. The contract handleS the logic for accumulating Gongde and minting NFTs when specific conditions are met.

Blockchain Integration: Hardhat, a development environment for Ethereum smart contracts, is utilized to build and deploy the smart contracts that power gongde accumulation and NFT minting. It ensures the security and reliability of the blockchain interactions within the DApp.

Front-end: React is used to build the user interface (UI) of the DApp. It provides a responsive and interactive platform for users to engage with the Muyu icon, track their Gongde, and manage their NFT collections.

IPFS for NFT Storage: NFT metadata and assets are stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized and efficient storage.

Partner Technologies: The DApp may partner with NFT marketplaces for users to trade or showcase their NFTs to a broader audience, enhancing the cultural and spiritual impact of the project.
