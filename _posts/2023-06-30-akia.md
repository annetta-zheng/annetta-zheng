[1. Plant Integrated Music Player, Identifier, and Status Monitor](https://github.com/annetta-zheng/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2023/Lab%201/README.md)

Setting: The device can be put in anywhere with plants, including home-decoration plants, lab plants, forest, jungle, etc. It reminds human of the weather and the health of soil. It can also play songs to the plants as needed, since plants will grow better when they listen to music!!!

Players: Every one can involved with the device, they can know the weather and the state of plants and they can also interact with the device for commmunication and mediation.

Activity: Each actor is independent. It does not matter whether who comes over, (unless with a version allows to implement detectors for botanic acadamic research purposes.)

Goals: Each player can pass by the device, waive to the device, water (the plants) on the device so that the plants can grow better.

[2. ClockIn, the Sensory Time Capsule Clock.](https://github.com/annetta-zheng/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2023/Lab%202/README.md)

The "Sensory Time Capsule" clock is designed to make time a multisensory and interactive experience. It focuses on measuring time in personal and meaningful ways, incorporating elements like background color change, background image change, text display, and interactive buttons. Instead of displaying hours and minutes conventionally, this clock encourages users to engage with time through their senses and emotions.

Baseline. Mirroring the changing emotions
The clock wil change its display and background color based on time as a reminding of time and avoking different energy or emotions to the users. (Please see video).

Interactions 1. Reflection Reminder
Instead of showing numerical time, the clock displays inspirational quotes, personal affirmations, or thought-provoking messages related to the time of day or the month of year. These messages are designed to stimulate reflection and mindfulness as well. (Please see video).

Interactions 2. Emotion Checker
The clock triggers a brief mindfulness exercise base on time, prompting users to reflect on their emotions and well-being. It might suggest a deep breath, a moment of gratitude, or a mindfulness exercise. (Please see video).

Interactions 3. Tour with Sustainability Awareness
The Clock will allow you take a brief break to another world at different altitude. After the tour it will display a enviormental issue

The current demo version is the Marine World, from 600 meters in the sky to -1000 meters in the water. It allows you to go to different levels of altitude or different views at the same sea level. After the tour, it will tell you how many marine animals have died because of the plastic during your touring time length. (Please see video).

Interactions #4: Chinese Divination
The clock will generate a divination based on Chinese Lunar Calender. 梅花易数 is a tradition Chinese divination method like tarot. However, I couldn't figure out how the code would work properly. The link contains the code I found for converting time to a divination.
